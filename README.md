# uniclass_ss_nrm_mapping
Full mapping table between Uniclass2015 Systems and NRM

Data mapped from Uniclass2015 System Ss table v1.9, Published January 2018

## Purpose of the mapping table
The Uniclass system table provides mapping to NRM codes. The Uniclass table has one or more NRM mappings (separated by a semicolon ;) on a single line.

This table maps every match of a Uniclass System code and an NRM code.

The Uniclass System table also provides identifies which NRM code (listed against the Uniclass System code) is 'default'. This table identifies the default NRM code in a new column.

This table also identifies where a unique Uniclass System code to NRM code occurs.
